# Matrix-manipulator using  C++
PF Project 
Matrix Manipulator 
Project: 
You are required to create a program that provides near-complete functionality over the 
matrix space. Users should be given a simple and smooth work flow that implements 
following details according to specs: 
Front end: 
        
        
        
        

 User can enter matrix personally or though files of their choosing 
User can get output on console or through files of their choosing 
Program should not end until user wishes to end their task 
User can enter Matrix of any size 
In case of file data entry each file will contain single matrix and you must use auto- 
grow techniques to read data 
Functional Requirements: 
        
        
        
        
        
Sum of Matrix (sum of all values) 
Product of Matrix (product of all values) 
Row-wise Average 
Column-wise Average 
Average or whole Matrix
 1 
2 
 
 
 
 
        Row-wise sorting of Matrix 
        Column-wise sorting of Matrix 
        Scalar Matrix Addition 
        Addition of two Matrices 
        Scalar Matrix Subtraction 
        Subtraction of two Matrices 
        Scalar Matrix Multiplication 
        Multiplication of two Matrices 
        Scalar Matrix Division 
        Matrix transpose 
        Matrix determinant 
        Matrix Inverse 
 
 
Back end: 
 
 Use separate function for every task listed above that is controlled by menu function 
which guides users through the various options 
        Use separate functions for helping tasks such as file input/output 
        Use structs to represent Matrices 
        Handle any and all sanity checks such as “size < 1” 
 In case there are any operations the program cannot perform, show a proper error 
message on screen to user to clearly state what is wrong with the input 
        Code should be thoroughly commented with appropriate details 
        There should be no memory leakage at all throughout the program 
        All code must be 100% generic
